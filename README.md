The data was taked from the following course  <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/"> "Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp" </a>

You just got some contract work with an Ecommerce company based in New York City that sells clothing online but they also have in-store style and clothing advice sessions. Customers come in to the store, have sessions/meetings with a personal stylist, then they can go home and order either on a mobile app or website for the clothes they want.
