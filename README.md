Hello, I’m Oswaldo Gallardo.I have completed my graduation in Physics and a Master in Sciences(Physics).
My research in science has focused on the study of orbital data around Galactic Centers using Markov Chains in Python lenguage.
I’m interested in learning about data science, analysis, interpreting, analyzing and reporting on data. 
I’m currently learning tools and techniques involved in data analysis and visualization in the industry.
